<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Jay and I am learning Full Stack Web Development.</p>

<p>This is something that I wanted to do since a long time now and I am glad to be able to make my first
  project. This is just the beginning and we are going to go a long way from here. Right now I am just glad to learn.
</p>

<p>I will be finishing the course in about a month or two depending on my grasp of concepts and I will make sure
  that this knowledge is put to good use. I will earn and make my living based on this knowledge and ensure that I support my gf and family through this.
  Looking forward to much more. Till then lets get to work.
